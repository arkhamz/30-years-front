## Inspiration & Overview:

The idea for History Mate came mostly from the many educational and interesting animated history documentary channels currently thriving on youtube. I greatly enjoy these channels, and wanted to try to create something myself, that someone could use to learn about a historical event or conflict, in an interactive way, compared to simply watching a 20-30 minute video.

## Features

When signed up and logged into the app, a user is able to view the real-life locations of points in a historical event, e.g. Significant battles of the Thirty Years' War. They can learn about these specific points, and test their knowledge with a small quiz, which allows them to unlock further points in the historical event/conflict, and related educational content. The user can also unlock different titles based on their progress

A user can also learn about the background/prelude to the historical event, as well as the main figures/persons. An observant user can also discover a simple minigame when exploring the app.

## Tech Summary
- HTML/CSS/Javascript
